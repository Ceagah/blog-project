### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# The blog project
This is a project that I'm building to learn Next.js. It's a front from a blog, and i'll conect it with a database created with Node.js.

This is a two-way project. The front is here, and the back is at [Backend](https://github.com/Ceagah/JWt-auth).
Here, i'm learning about Next.js and how to use it to create a blog. My goal is to create a blog that will be a part of my portfolio.
